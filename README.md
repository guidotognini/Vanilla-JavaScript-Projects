# Vanilla JavaScript Projects

Welcome to the Vanilla JavaScript Projects repository! This collection of projects serves as a practical avenue for reinforcing fundamental JavaScript concepts and exploring its built-in methods. Initially inspired by a tutorial led by John Smilga ([watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4)), this repository aims to provide small, enhanced implementations based on the suggested code.

The primary objective here isn't to dwell extensively on each project. Instead, it's a stepping stone in my seven-week journey towards securing a junior backend developer position. I've incorporated incremental improvements to the original code, detailed and accessible within each project's codebase.

## Projects Included:

- [Project 1: Color Flipper](https://github.com/guidotognini/Vanilla-JavaScript-Projects/tree/35084e83297976e5ade386b4fbc637de4e84c873/01-color-flipper) - This project showcases the implementation of arrow function syntax, resulting in cleaner and more concise code. Additionally, I optimized the code by utilizing '.onclick' instead of 'addEventListener'.
- [Project 2: Counter](https://github.com/guidotognini/Vanilla-JavaScript-Projects/tree/1a9ee232f01e5cd0dd6b2729707a925aa0be40da/02-counter/setup) - Counter showcases DOM manipulation with event handling using .onclick for button interactions, employs array methods to manage button selection, and dynamically styles based on count values, solidifying JavaScript fundamentals
- Other projects are gonna be added day by day

Feel free to explore each project folder to witness the enhancements and optimizations made to the initial code snippets. This repository is a dynamic space where I'm refining my JavaScript skills and assimilating crucial concepts essential for my upcoming role as a backend developer.

Your feedback, suggestions, or contributions are warmly welcomed! Let's embark on this learning journey together.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
